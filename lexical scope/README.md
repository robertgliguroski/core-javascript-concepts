# Lexical scope in Javascript

In book #2 of the "You don't know JS" series, titled "Scope & Closures", Kyle Simpson explains that - "contrary to popular belief, Javascript does have a compiler. All the code is being compiled prior to it being interpreted. It is not compiled well in advance as are other languages(C#, Java), but it is stil compiled. The compiler plays a key role in hoisting, which is moving the variable and function declarations to the top of the code so that they are processed by the compiler before anything else when the Javascript code is being executed by the Javascript engine. In fact, all the declarations in Javascript are processed during the compilation phase, while the assignments and other executable logic are left in place for the execution phase".

I will hereby give several examples of the lexical scoping rules in Javascript and how they connect to the mechanism known as "hoisting". Please refer to the file called "hoisting.js" which contains example code together with an appropriate explanation for each block of code, wrapped in a comment block.
