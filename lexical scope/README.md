Contrary to popular belief, Javascript does have a compiler. All the code is being
	compiled prior to it being interpreted. It is not compiled well in advance as are other
	languages(C#, Java), but it is stil compiled. The compiler plays a key role in hoisting,
	which is moving the variable and function declarations to the top of the code so that they are processed
	by the compiler before anything else when the Javascript code is being executed by the Javascript engine.
	In fact, all the declarations in Javascript are processed during the compilation phase, while 
	the assignments and other executable logic are left in place for the execution phase.
